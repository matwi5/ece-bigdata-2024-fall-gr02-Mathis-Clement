    style Core1 fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style Core2 fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

**Explanation:**

-   **Master Node (m7g.xlarge)**: Hosts the Spark Driver, which orchestrates the Spark application, and the YARN ResourceManager, which manages cluster resources.
-   **Core Nodes (r7i.xlarge)**: Each core node runs two Spark Executors, responsible for executing tasks and storing data in memory or on disk.
-   **YARN**: YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator) manages the allocation of resources to Spark applications and schedules tasks across the cluster.
-   **Spark Driver**: The Spark Driver program runs on the master node, coordinating the execution of Spark jobs, dividing them into tasks, and scheduling them on the executors.
-   **Spark Executors**: Executors are worker processes that run on the core nodes, executing tasks assigned by the driver and storing data partitions.

### 2.2. Resource Allocation

The cluster is configured to utilize the resources of the core nodes effectively:

-   **Executors per Core Node**: 2
-   **Total Executors**: 4 (2 executors x 2 core nodes)
-   **Cores per Executor**: 2
-   **Memory per Executor**: 4GB

This configuration allows for parallel processing of data partitions across the cluster, maximizing throughput and reducing processing time.

## 3. Spark Configuration

### 3.1. Cluster Mode Configuration

The Spark application runs in `cluster` mode on YARN, leveraging the EMR cluster's resources for distributed processing.

**Key Configuration Parameters:**

-   `spark.submit.deployMode`: `cluster` - Specifies that the Spark Driver runs on the cluster (master node) rather than on the client machine.
-   `spark.master`: `yarn` - Sets YARN as the resource manager for Spark.
-   `spark.yarn.jars`: `local:/usr/lib/spark/jars/*` - Specifies the location of Spark JARs on the EMR cluster, optimizing job submission by using local resources.

### 3.2. Memory Management

Memory management is crucial for Spark performance. The configuration is optimized for the `r7i.xlarge` instances, balancing memory allocation between execution and storage.

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme': 'dark'}}%%
flowchart TD
    subgraph Executor["Spark Executor Memory (4GB)"]
        direction TB
        OM["Overhead Memory
        (spark.executor.memoryOverhead)
        1GB"]
        SM["Spark Memory
        (spark.executor.memory)
        3GB"]
        
        SM --> |"spark.memory.fraction (0.6)"| MEM["Managed Memory
        (Execution + Storage)
        1.8 GB"]
        SM --> |"spark.memory.storageFraction (0.5)"| UMEM["Unmanaged Memory
        (User Memory)
        1.2 GB"]
        
        MEM --> EX["Execution Memory"]
        MEM --> ST["Storage Memory"]
    end
```

**Explanation:**

-   **Executor Memory (`spark.executor.memory`)**: 4GB per executor, providing ample space for task execution and data storage.
-   **Overhead Memory (`spark.executor.memoryOverhead`)**: 1GB per executor, reserved for non-heap memory usage, including VM overheads, interned strings, and other native overhead.
-   **Spark Memory Fraction (`spark.memory.fraction`)**: 0.6 (default), meaning 60% of the executor memory (excluding overhead) is used for Spark's managed memory (execution and storage), which is 1.8 GB.
-   **Storage Memory Fraction (`spark.memory.storageFraction`)**: 0.5 (default), meaning 50% of Spark's managed memory is reserved for caching data (0.9 GB after calculation), with the remaining 50% used for execution.
-   **Execution Memory**: Used for operations like shuffles, joins, sorts, and aggregations.
-   **Storage Memory**: Used for caching and persisting data in memory.
-   **User Memory**: The remaining 40% of the executor memory (excluding overhead), managed by the user and used for storing user-defined data structures and any objects created during the execution of user code.

**Rationale:**

-   This memory configuration ensures that executors have sufficient memory for both processing tasks and caching data.
-   The overhead memory prevents out-of-memory errors due to non-heap memory usage.
-   The balance between execution and storage memory allows for efficient data processing while also enabling caching of frequently accessed data.

### 3.3. Executor Configuration

The executor configuration is optimized for parallel processing and resource utilization across the two core nodes.

-   **Number of Executors**: 4 (2 per core node) - This allows for concurrent execution of tasks across the cluster, maximizing parallelism.
-   **Cores per Executor (`spark.executor.cores`)**: 2 - Each executor can run two tasks concurrently, balancing parallelism and resource usage.
-   **Dynamic Allocation (`spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled`)**: `true` - Enables Spark to dynamically adjust the number of executors based on workload demands.
    -   `spark.dynamicAllocation.minExecutors`: 2
    -   `spark.dynamicAllocation.maxExecutors`: 6
    -   `spark.dynamicAllocation.initialExecutors`: 2
    -   `spark.dynamicAllocation.executorIdleTimeout`: 60s
    -   `spark.dynamicAllocation.schedulerBacklogTimeout`: 1s
    -   `spark.dynamicAllocation.sustainedSchedulerBacklogTimeout`: 5s

**Rationale:**

-   Dynamic allocation allows the cluster to efficiently utilize resources by scaling the number of executors up or down based on the workload.
-   The minimum and maximum executor settings provide boundaries for scaling, ensuring that the application has sufficient resources while preventing excessive resource consumption.

### 3.4. Network and Storage

-   **Network Timeout (`spark.network.timeout`)**: `800s` -  Increased timeout to accommodate potentially long-running operations and prevent timeouts during data shuffling or other network-intensive tasks.
-   **Serializer (`spark.serializer`)**: `org.apache.spark.serializer.KryoSerializer` - Uses Kryo serialization for efficient data serialization, improving performance compared to the default Java serializer.
-   **Kryo Buffer Max (`spark.kryoserializer.buffer.max`)**: `1024m` -  Sets the maximum buffer size for Kryo serialization, allowing for serialization of larger objects.
-   **Storage Level (`spark.storage.level`)**: `MEMORY_AND_DISK_SER` -  Specifies that data should be stored in memory when possible, falling back to disk if necessary, and serialized to reduce memory usage.

### 3.5 Other Key Configurations

-   **Event Log Directory (`spark.eventLog.dir`)**: `hdfs:///var/log/spark/apps` - Specifies the HDFS directory for storing Spark event logs, enabling monitoring and debugging of Spark applications.
-   **History Server Address (`spark.history.ui.port`)**: `18080` - Sets the port for the Spark History Server UI, allowing users to view the history of completed Spark applications.
-   **Shuffle Service Port (`spark.shuffle.service.port`)**: `7337` - Defines the port for the external shuffle service.
-   **YARN Scheduler Address (`spark.yarn.scheduler.address`)**: `<master-node-private-ip>:8030` -  Specifies the address of the YARN ResourceManager, enabling Spark to communicate with YARN for resource allocation.
-   **Driver Cores (`spark.driver.cores`)**: `4` -  Allocates 4 cores to the Spark Driver, providing sufficient resources for managing the application and collecting results.

## 4. Data Processing Implementation
